                                    <h2>Course Introduction</h2> AI for Social Good is a course which is being jointly taught by Dr. Milind Tambe (Viterbi School of Engineering) and Dr. Eric Rice (Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work).  The purpose of the class is to expose doctoral students and advanced masters level students to a new field of research which merges research techniques in artificial intelligence with theory and research contexts from social work.  The course is attached to Drs. Tambe and Rice’s new Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society (CAIS).  This course is intended to be trans-disciplinary.  It will be a small seminar style course, with limited enrollment. The intention is to have half of the student body from engineering and social work respectively. There is no need for programming experience or social work practice experience per se, however, a deep connection to either social work or computer science is needed.  The course will provide an overview of major methods that can advance this new trans-disciplinary work, from both a conceptual level in computer science and a conceptual level in social work.  Topics from engineering will include decision theory, sequential planning under uncertainty, and machine learning predictive models.  Topics from social work will include human behavior theories that can be modeled by AI (such as social cognitive theory and social network theory) as well as context driven topics, such as homelessness and health care access.  The course meets weekly, is a discussion style course and will include an emphasis on group projects which are tackled in trans-disciplinary teams.

                                        PhD students are expected to participate heavily in teaching concepts to the other half of the class. PhD students should team up in exercises. Each class will typically introduce concepts and generate some exercises for the class to be jointly done. </p>

                                    In both cases, we will introduce what is the history of the field, what are some major schools of thought, what are current trends. We will introduce basics, things taken for granted. For example, experiment design, IRB approval, search… A key topic of this class will be to get students to form teams. Teams must include students from social work and AI; while teaming arrangements could change over time, the initial team will be responsible for delivering potential topics for book chapters by Feb 6.

You are encouraged to report any incidents to the Office of Equity and Diversity http://equity.usc.edu/ or to the Department of Public Safety http://capsnet.usc.edu/department/department-public-safety/online-forms/contact-us. This is important for the safety whole USC community. Another member of the university community – such as a friend, classmate, advisor, or faculty member – can help initiate the report, or can initiate the report on behalf of another person. The Center for Women and Men http://www.usc.edu/student-affairs/cwm/ provides 24/7 confidential support, and the sexual assault resource center webpage sarc@usc.edu describes reporting options and other resources.

He is an expert in social network theory, social network analysis, and the application of social network methods to HIV prevention research. Rice is committed to community-based participatory research. Rice has an interest in conducting work on HIV prevention with high risk adolescent populations. He has worked closely with many community-based organizations over the past seven years, working primarily on issues of HIV prevention for homeless youth and impoverished families affected by HIV/AIDS. Rice has served as an external reviewer for Los Angeles County's Office of AIDS Programs and Policy and has conducted program evaluation and consultation with organizations working with homeless youth and high risk adolescents. Rice's current work focuses on developing an online social networking, HIV prevention program for homeless youth funded through a grant from National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
